# UPI Transactions Analysis - Power BI Project 3

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Unified Payments Interface (UPI)** transactions using **Power BI** to uncover insights into transaction patterns, balances, and user behavior across different cities, devices, and banks.  
The dataset was loaded into **Power BI Desktop**, followed by extensive data profiling and visualization building.


## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI Desktop** (Data transformation and visualization)
- **Power Query Editor** (Data profiling and cleaning)
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** (Calculated columns and measures)


## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Profiling**:
   - Loaded the UPI transactions dataset into Power BI Desktop.
   - Performed **data profiling** and transformations using **Power Query Editor**.

2. **Data Enhancements**:
   - Created a new **Age** column using **DAX** to categorize users by age groups.


## Key Visualizations and Features

- **Slicers**:
  - Added multiple slicers to filter data interactively by:
    - **Bank Name Sent**
    - **Bank Name Received**
    - **City**
    - **Device Type**
    - **Gender**
    - **Age Group**
    - **Merchant Name**
    - **Payment Method**
    - **Purpose**
    - **Transaction Type**

- **Line Chart**:
  - Created a **Balance by Month 2024** line chart showing the monthly trends of account balances.

- **Matrix Visual** (Page 2):
  - Developed a matrix to display **Remaining Balance** across **different cities**, **currencies**, and **months**.

- **Conditional Formatting**:
  - Applied conditional formatting to highlight key trends and anomalies based on balance values.

- **Slicer Syncing**:
  - Synchronized slicers across multiple report pages to ensure consistent filtering.

- **Bookmarks Feature** (Page 1):
  - Implemented bookmarks allowing users to easily switch between:
    - **Line Chart - Amounts**
    - **Column Chart - Amounts**
    - **Line Chart - Balances**
    - **Column Chart - Balances**


## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Refresh the dataset if needed.
4. Use the slicers and bookmarks to interactively explore the UPI transaction data!
